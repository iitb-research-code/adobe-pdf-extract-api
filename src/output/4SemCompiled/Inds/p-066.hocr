          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 308 1409 353">4. UNRECOGNISED POLITICAL PARTIES: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2117 683">In India, there are unrecognised political parties also. Such political parties have the right to contest elections and to take part in all types of political activities, but these don't have reserved election symbols rather these are alloted to them at the time of election. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 771 1055 816">5. MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 902 2118 1146">In India, there is not one party system, as is in China, nor two party system like Britain and America. In our country, there is a multi-party system. On the eve of Seventeenth Lok Sabha general elections (2019), there were 7 national parties, 52 state parties and 2354 registered-unrecognised parties in the country. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1233 1290 1279">6. ONE-DOMINANT PARTY SYSTEM: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1365 2119 1675">In spite of the multi party system, the political scene in India was dominated for a long period by the congress. The dominant position enjoyed by the Congress has been declining since 1967 with the rise of regional parties and other national parties like Janata (1977). Janta Dal (1989) and the BJP (1991) leading to the development of a competitive multi-party system. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1762 2116 1874">7. REBEGINING OF THE PERIOD OF ONE PARTY RULE IN CENTRE AND STATES: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1960 2118 2270">Since independence upto 1977 and again from 1980 to 1989, there have been the governments of the Congress Party in the Centre and in most of the states which continued upto 2014. But in 2014 and 2019 with the advent of NDA government led by BJP, the period of the emergence of the party rule had started which continues even today. As a result of this, again in India, the period of one party rule has begun. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2357 1946 2403">8. ABSENCE OF STRONG AND WELL ORGANISED OPPOSITION: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2489 2117 2997">One peculiar feature of India party system is absence of strong and well organised opposition. At present, both at the national and state level there are so many national and regional political parties playing the role of opposition but they are not united on various political issues not they have any common programme. Different political parties do criticize the government inside and outside the Parliament, but they also indulge in the politics of competition which is harmful to democracy. In the 16th Lok Sabha no political party was able to get the number of seats required to get the status of recognised opposition party. </span>
