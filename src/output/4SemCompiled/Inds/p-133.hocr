      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2117 1212">It looks as if the factor of Hung Parliament has become an outs ding characteristics of our National Politics. When after the results of general elections to the Lok Sabha no party gets an absolute majority in it, then the Parliament is known as Hung Parliament. In our country from 1989 to 2009 about seven general elections have been arranged, but the result of every general election was a Hung Parliament. It was for the First time after 1989 that the practice of Hung Parliament was discontinued by the results of the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha. Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as a single largest Party in the Lok Sabha and thus the practice of Hung Parliament was discontinued. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1431 2118 2270">The Parliamentary Democracy exists in India. In this system the party enjoying majority in the Lok Sabha forms the government so every political party desires to win majority in the Lok Sabha. In order to fulfill their desire, political parties try to appease some important religious minorities so that they can get the maximum votes. This policy of appeasement of religious minorities influences the Indian politics on two sides. Firstly, it increases religious fanaticism of religious minorities because they feel that a particular political party shows a particular interest in them because they have special importance in the constituency as a religious minority. This feeling colours their attitude in communalism, Secondly, when majority opposes the policy of appeasement of minorities, the opposition gives power to a minority or minorities to be united on one hand and motivate majority people to be united in the name of religion on the other hand. All this is responsible for communalisation of the Indian politics. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2489 2118 3195">Because of their sense of insecurity India is a mu -religious country and here reside several religious minorities. Every religious minority has a great attachment with its religion and culture. Every religious minority has an ardent desire to have a separate identity. Such a desire of religious minorities inspires their members to be united so that they can pressurize the government collectively for the development of interests of people of their respective religions. Such organisations of religious minorities become responsible for communalisation of politics. When different religious based political organisations enter politics, communalisation of politics is quite natural. Clever leaders of religious minorities, for their vested interests, exploit emotionally the religious sentiments of people of their religion. They often propagate that their religion is in danger and religious majority of the country is trying openly or secretly </span>
