          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 307 2116 418">nature of Indian politics was different. Since independence numerous trends in Indian politics have emerged from time to time. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 507 1363 552">10.3. MEANING OF TRENDS IN POLITICS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2118 1146">Politics is a struggle for power. It is a struggle for power and it concerns with what, when and how as political power in society. Whenever, in the game of politics, the means and methods of gaining and maintaining power developed, these are termed as trends of politics of a country. With the passage of time, new situations are emerges in politics .The new trends do not get well established very soon rather they take sufficient time to penetrate in to psyche of the people. The developing trends in politics are known as emerging trends in politics. Some of the emerging trends of Indian politics may be summarized as follow: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1234 2117 1345">1. POSSIBILITY OF RE-EMERGENCE OF SINGLE DOMINANT MULTI- PARTY SYSTEM:-</span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1431 2117 2204">For a long time, the monopoly of congress remained both at the centre and in the states and this era is known as the era of one party dominance. But, this trend suffered a serious set -back and for some years it was not in practice in our country. From 1989 to 26th may 2014 there remained coalition governments in power. Two alliances that is N.D.A and U.P.A held the sway during this period. But results of 16th Lok Sabha elections announced on 16th May 2014 once again witnessed the re-emergence of one dominate party in multi- party system of India and many regional parties were completely washed out in hunting and three national parties also suffered electoral set back to this extent that they were likely to lose the status of being national parties of the country. They were communist party of India, Bahujan Samaj party and nationalist congress party. All this is an indication of re- emergence of one dominant party in India. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2292 2014 2337">2. INCREASING NUMBER OF REGIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES:- </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2423 2117 2799">The number of regional political parties in Indian politics is increasing day by day. Right from the beginning in 1952 the number of state parties was alarming. At the time of 16th Lok Sabha elections the number of state parties was 3000, which were registered with the election commission. Out of them only 56 were given recognition by the election commission. So, there is an urgent need to check the growth of reasons which give rise to the state parties. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2887 1833 2932">3. INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL PARTIES:-</span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 3029 2117 3140">The importance of regional parties has been increasing to the extent that government of more political parties is in power in states than these of national parties. Regional </span>
