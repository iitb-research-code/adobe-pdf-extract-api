      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 427 2118 749">In PUCL v. UOI 63 where The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties approached the Supreme Court challenging Section 33B of the Representation of People (Third Amendment) Act which nullified the decision in Association for Democratic Reforms by providing that candidates contesting elections need not file affidavit of criminal antecedents and particulars as directed by the Court. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 759 2117 1080">This provision was held unconstitutional and void as it infringed the ―right of electors' to know‖, a constituent of the fundamental right to free speech and expression and hindered free and fair elections, which is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Subsequently, all criminal records and antecedents of candidates contesting elections are now mandated to be matters of public record. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1089 2118 1873">Further the court in K. Prabhakarn vs. P. Jayarajan 64 the Court elucidated upon the scope and purport of Section 8(3) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 which provides criteria for disqualification. It was observed that the purpose of enacting disqualification under Section 8(3) of RPA is to prevent criminalization of politics. Those who break the law should not make the law. Generally speaking, the purpose sought to be achieved by enacting disqualification on conviction for certain offences is to prevent persons with criminal background from entering into politics and governance. Persons with criminal background pollute the process of election, as they have no reservation from indulging in criminality to win an election. Thus, Section 8 seeks to promote freedom and fairness at elections. The provision has to be so meaningfully construed as to effectively prevent the mischief sought to be prevented. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1894 2119 2402">Going a step further, A 2 Judge bench of the Supreme Court in 2013 in Lily Thomas vs. UOI 65 ruled that Members of Parliament, Legislative Councils and Legislative Assemblies convicted of crimes where they had been awarded a minimum sentence of 2 years imprisonment would cease to be members of the house to which they were elected from the date of sentencing. It further struck down the provision, which allowed convicted members a 3 month time period for appeal against the conviction and sentencing and held that those convicted would suffer immediate disqualification. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2411 2118 2733">In Manoj Narula v. Union of India, 66 the Supreme Court said that criminalization of politics is an anathema to the sacredness of democracy. It has been noted in the N.N. Vohra Committee that the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminal elements is on rise. 67 In 2017, the Hon‘ble Supreme Court of India in Abhiram Singh v C.D.
