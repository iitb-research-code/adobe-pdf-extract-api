          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 296 2118 1344">―The Law Commission has proposed wide ranging reforms on the issue of candidate expenditure limits; disclosure obligations of individual candidates and political parties; and penalties imposable on political parties; as well as examining the issue of state funding of elections. Section 77 of the RPA, regulating the election expenses incurred or authorized by candidates or their election agents, currently extends from the date of nomination to the date of declaration of results. This period should be extended by amending section 77(1) to apply from the date of notification of the elections to the date of declaration of results. The existing disclosure obligations of individual candidates are limited to maintaining an account of electoral expenses under sections 77 and 78, RPA. This is sought to be amended by inserting a new section 77A to require candidates or their election agents to maintain an account and disclose the particulars (names, addresses and PAN card numbers of donors and amounts contributed) of (i) any individual contribution received by them from any person or company, not being a Government company and (ii) any contribution by the political party from the date of notification of elections, which have to be made by the party by a crossed account payee cheque or draft or bank transfer.‖ </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1365 2117 2071">Every financial year, political parties shall be required to keep and submit annual accounts to the ECI, which should be audited by a qualified and practicing chartered accountant from a panel of such accountants maintained for that purpose by the Comptroller and Auditor General. These accounts will detail all of the funds received by the party as well as the expenses it has incurred. On payment of a fee, the ECI will upload these accounts online or keep them on file for public inspection. Disclosure provisions governing political parties have been substantially recast. The existing section 29C has been deleted and replaced by a new section 29D that req uires all political parties to : (I) disclose all contribution in excess of Rs of 20,000; (II) include aggregate contributions from a single donor in excess of Rs. 20,000 within its scope; and </span>

Consequential changes will be made (IV) Disclose such particulars even for contributions less than Rs. 20,000 if such contributions exceed Rs. 20 crore or 20 % of the party‘s total contributions, whichever is less. Consequential amendments will need to be made to the Election Rules and the IT Act. </span>

Union of India, 62 while dealing with the question of criminalization of politics held that under the Indian Constitution, electors had a fundamental right to know the antecedents of candidates contesting elections to hold public office. The court read in ‗right to be informed‘ as a right flowing from freedom of speech and expression. It mandated the </span>
