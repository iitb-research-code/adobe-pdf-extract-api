Gupta v Union of India 20 is also known as First Judges case, the question before the SC was among the various functionaries participating in the appointment process , who should have the primacy? The majority 21 gave literal meaning to the word ‗consultative‘ and held that the opinions of the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court were merely consultative and that ―the power of appointment resides solely and exclusively in the Central Government‖ and that the Central Government could override the opinions given by the constitutional functionaries.

The two judges case clarified that advice of Chief Justice of India would be supreme but this case laid down that it is not solely the opinion of Chief Justice of India but opinion of plurality of Judges. </span>
