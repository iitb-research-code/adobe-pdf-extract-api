      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1010 2118 1981">The SC has given remarkable judgments to improve the process of elections and emphasized on the importance of free and fair elections. Kihoto Hollohon v. Zachillhu and Others, 74 the Supreme Court considered free and fair election as basic structure of Indian Constitution. In Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms and Another, 75 the Court held that the Election Commission has power to issue directions or orders on the related subject matter in the absence of any legislation. The court further declared that citizens‘ freedom of speech and expression includes the right to know about the backgrounds of candidates for public office. It would be helpful for the voter to choose the right candidate. each candidate must submit an affidavit regarding the information of his/her criminal antecedents; assets (both movable and immovable) of self and those of spouses and dependents as well; and qualifications at the time of filing his/her nomination papers for election to the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. The Apex Court again in PUCL v. Union of India 76 guarded the citizen‘s right to know the antecedents about his or her candidate in election. </span>
