      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 522 2118 1361">The number of Vidhan Sabha members cannot be more than 500 and not less than 60. However, very small States have been allowed to have lesser number of members. Thus, Goa has only 40 members in its Assembly. Uttar Pradesh (is a big state even after creation of Uttaranchal from this state in 2002) has 403 seats in the Assembly. The Governor of the State has the power to nominate one member of Anglo-Indian community if this community is not adequately represented in the House. As in case of the Lok Sabha, some seats are reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes. The tenure of Vidhan Sabha is five years, but the Governor can dissolve it before the completion of its term on the advice of Chief Minister. It may be dissolved by the President in case of constitutional emergency proclaimed under Article 356 of the Constitution. In case of proclamation of national emergency (under Article 352) the Parliament can extend the term of the Legislative Assemblies for a period not exceeding one year at a time. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1426 1427 1470">2.3.3. PRESIDING OFFICER (THE SPEAKER) </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1531 2118 2172">The members of Vidhan Sabha elect their presiding officer. The Presiding officer is known as the Speaker. The Speaker presides over the meetings of the House and conducts its proceedings. He maintains order in the House, allows the member to ask questions and speak on the issues of public. He puts bills and other measures to vote and announces the result of voting. The Speaker does not ordinarily vote at the time of voting. However, he may exercise casting vote in case of a tie. The Deputy Speaker presides over the meeting during the absence of the Speaker. He is also elected by the Assembly from amongst its members. A tie means that equal numbers of members have voted in favour and against a bill or resolution. To break the tie, casting vote is exercised by the presiding officer of the Legislative Assembly. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2236 1590 2281">2.4. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL (VIDHAN PARISHAD) </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2342 2118 3181">Vidhan Parishad is the upper House of the State Legislature. It is not in existence in very State. Very few States have bicameral Legislature that means having two Houses. At present six states viz. Utter Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have Vidhan Parishad while, remaining 22 States have one House, i.e. Vidhan Sabha. Legislative Councils are legacy of the British period. The Parliament can create Vidhan Parishad in a State where it does not exist, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to this effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting, and sends the resolution to the Parliament. Similarly, if a State has a Council and the Assembly wants it to be abolished, it may adopt a resolution by similar majority and send it to Parliament. In this situation Parliament resolves to abolish the concerned Legislative Council. Accordingly, Councils of Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were abolished. </span>
