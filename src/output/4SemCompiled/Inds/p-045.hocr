      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 505 2118 1146">The president may after consultation with the Chief Justice of India transfer a judge from one high court to any other High Court. In Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth 27 it was held that independence of judiciary is the vital ingredient of our legal system and the threat of transfer at the whims and caprices of the executive constitutes a major inroad in that independence i.e. When judge is under a constant fear of being transferred, he will never be able to do full and complete justice. Thus it was held that a judge can be transferred only in interest of public. Any transfer not in Public Interest, can be challenged in courts as ultra vires. The minority view in this judgment opined that no transfer could be made without consent of the judge concerned. But the majority held that no such consent was required. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1221 2118 1807">The judgment was followed in case of SP Gupta v. UOI 28 which reiterated that consultation with CJI is necessary and transfer should be made in public interest. It cannot be used as threat or punishment to judges. Several more clarifications were made by the SC in Second judges 29 case and Third judges 30 case. It was laid down that CJI shall form his opinion in consultation with Chief Justice of that High Court and Chief Justice of High Court where judge is to be transferred. The proposition has been reiterated that there is no requirement of prior consent of the Judge before his transfer. A transfer is subject to judicial review but only the transferred judge has locus standi to question his transfer and no one else. 31 </span>
