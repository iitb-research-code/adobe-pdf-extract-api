          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 301 1246 357"> IN RELATION TO MONEY BILLS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 410 2117 984">Like in the Lok Sabha, money bill is introduced first in Vidhan Sabha. It cannot be initiated in the Vidhan Parishad. The Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha certifies whether a particular bill is a money bill. After the bill is passed in the Vidhan Sabha, it is sent to the Vidhan Parishad. The Vidhan Parishad gets 14 days time to consider the bill. If the Parishad passes the bill, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. If the bill is not returned by the Vidhan Parishad within 14 days, it is deemed to have been passed by the Vidhan Parishad. If it suggests certain changes in the bill and sends to Vidhan Sabha, the Vidhan Sabha may accept or reject the changes suggested by the Parishad. The bill is then sent to the Governor for his assent who is bound to give his assent. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1041 1300 1097"> CONTROL OVER THE EXECUTIVE </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1150 2117 1460">The Council of Ministers of the State is responsible to the Vidhan Sabha only and remains in the office so long as it enjoys the confidence of the Assembly (Vidhan Sabha). Although members in the Vidhan Parishad can ask questions, introduce adjournment motions, calling attention notices, etc. yet the Vidhan Parishad cannot remove the government. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1516 1083 1572"> ELECTORAL FUNCTIONS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1625 2117 2001">Only the elected members of the Vidhan Sabha are entitled to participate in the election of the President of India. The members of the Vidhan Sabha do so in their capacity as the members of the Electoral College. But the members of the Vidhan Parishad are not entitled to vote in the election of the President. Members of the Rajya Sabha from each State are elected only by the members of Assembly and not of the Council. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2063 2117 2572">The above discussion makes it clear that the Vidhan Parishad is powerless and non-influential House. Keeping in view its weak, powerless and insignificant position and role of Legislative Council, the critics have described the council as ‗secondary chamber‘, ‗costly ornamental luxury‘, ‗white elephant‘, etc. Thus, many States prefer to have unicameral Legislature. But the Vidhan Parishad is not superfluous. It serves as a check on hasty Legislation made by Vidhan Sabha by highlighting the short bills comings or defects of the bill. It lessens the burden of the Vidhan Sabha, as some bills are initiated in the Vidhan Parishad </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2636 1886 2680">2.8. POSITION OR CHANGING ROLE OF STATE LEGISLATURE </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2742 2118 3052">The State Legislature occupies the same position in a state as is the position of the Parliament in the Union. There is, however, a difference of degree in their relative powers. Indian Unitarian Federalism makes the Union Parliament more powerful than each state legislature. Further, there are several specific limitations on the powers of a state legislature. </span>
