      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2118 1212">The chief minister is the leader of the majority party in the state legislative assembly. He has also great influence over the business in the state legislature. All principal announcements of policy are made by him. He intervenes in debates of general importance. He can appease an angry house by promising immediate relief or concessions when needed. He is in a position to get any legislation passed which is within the competence of the state legislature. He is authorized to advise the governor to dissolve the legislative assembly. The Governor being a constitutional ruler generally acts upon the advice of the chief minister. He is more than a primus inter pares. </span>

This however does not mean that the Governor can dismiss his ministers at his will. The Government is in fact dependent on the chief minister. The members of the council of ministers hold office as long as they enjoy the confidence of the chief minister. In case the member of council of ministers loses the confidence of the Chief Minister he has to resign. In case the member refuses to submit his resignation, the chief minister can advise the governor to dismiss such a minister. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2555 2117 2931">The chief minister is also an important channel of communication between the council of ministers and the state legislature. He plays an important role in the deliberations and discussions of the house and defends his governmentâ€˜s policies on the floor of the house. The major onslaughts of the opposition in legislature are also faced by him. In relation to the state legislature the chief minister has considerable influence over the laws that are to be passed by the legislature. </span>
