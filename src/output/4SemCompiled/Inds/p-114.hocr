      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 404 2117 1055">Women‘s participation in politics of any country gives a strong message globally not only in terms of equality and freedom of liberty but also in the space provided for women in the democratic framework of electoral politics. India has one of the strongest laws that provide women a life with full honor and dignity. But the customs, patriarchal set ups and societal norms have always treated them as subordinate to men. They are always taught to be submissive. Because of unequal distribution of resources, women do not have adequate resources, be it economic, material or human. Women are expected to work in private sphere only and are generally barred from working outside their homes. Their financial dependence over men also keeps them away from strong political affiliations. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1117 2118 1560">Politics as a real-world phenomenon and political science as an academic discipline are gendered. People all over the world find that the basic conditions of their lives—their safety, health, education, work, as well as access to markets, public space, and free expression—are fundamentally shaped by their identification as belonging to particular sex or gender groups.

Conventional politics reflected male concerns and hence women were notably absent in politics. But on the other side it is heartening to note that Indian women were among the earliest to get their political rights like right to vote without any political movement like in die United States and many Western countries. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2079 2118 2521">The term 'political participation' has a very wide meaning. It is not only related to 'Right to Vote', but to participation in decision-making process, political activism, political consciousness, etc. In India, participation in voting, place in public offices and political parties has lower than men. Political activism and voting are the strongest areas of women's political participation. To combat gender inequality in politics, Indian Government gave 33% reservation in Rural Local and Urban Local Bodies. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2566 2118 3075">In India, reform movements before and after independence has helped women to gain some power in politics also. After independence they have achieved an unprecedented political breakthrough with the reservation of seats for them in Panchayats and other public bodies. Women have held the posts of president and prime minister in India, as well as chief ministers of various states. Indian voters have elected women to numerous state legislative assemblies and national parliament for many decades. Welfare policies had been constructed and reinforced women‘s traditional position as wives and mothers. Women have struggled over issues </span>
