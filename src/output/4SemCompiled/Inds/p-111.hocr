      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 415 2119 1386">The Indian Constitution expressly declares that there is no official religion in India. We live in a "secular state." In India, people of all faiths enjoy the freedom to practice any religion they want. And these rights cannot be used as a basis for discrimination. It all begins with the concept of communalism. The concept of communalism is that one religion or ethnic group believes itself to be superior to another. And, rather than considering the larger community, believers of this religion will always align with their party. This communalism has been exploited to acquire political dominance in our country since the inception of political parties. For them, it is a means of obtaining votes based on religious beliefs. To stoke the fires of communalism, they frequently bring up issues of majority/minority religions. Instead of creating a spirit of unity, this causes division among the people. Surprisingly, it is not illegal in India to form a political party based on religion or caste. They have the right to form such organizations and parties since they are free to practice any faith, however in the pretext of preserving their member's interests. Nowhere else on the planet is caste and casteism so thoroughly ingrained in a country's society and politics. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1448 2117 2287">Our caste system, which has existed since ancient times, was rigid and extensive, making its ultimate abolition impossible. We have made progress as a result of urbanization and modernity, but we have not been able to entirely eradicate it. The caste system still exists in villages and towns, even though it is nearly nonexistent in major cities. Political parties make use of the fact that members of the same caste tend to vote in the same way. They pick a candidate based on his caste, not his qualifications. People from the so-called lower caste or suppressed caste now have a voice at the policy level, which is a good thing. They have spokespeople from their ranks who are familiar with their hardships and issues. Politics and caste have the opposite effect. In our country, politics has an impact on caste. Many lesser castes and sub-castes have banded together for political reasons, which is a significant move. They see that there is strength in numbers, and they build internal alliances. There is also further division taking place based on the group's political influence. </span>
