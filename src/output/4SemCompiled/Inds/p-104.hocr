The secularist ideas that preserve and undergird many of our liberties like Separation of religious and governmental institutions, as well as a public realm in which religion can participate but not control, freedom to practice one's faith or believe without causing harm to others, or to modify or abandon it as one sees fit and equality so that our religious views, whether we have them or not, do not place us at a disadvantage. Secularism is founded on religious liberty. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Church of England and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland are both officially recognized Christian denominations.
