      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1274 2118 1782">A High Court is a Court of record and has all the powers of such a Court including the powers to punish for its contempt. Contempt has been defined in Contempt of Courts Act 1971. Under this the contempt may be criminal or civil. Willful disobedience to any judgment, order, writ, or other legal process is known as civil contempt. The publication of any matter or the performance of any conduct that a) scandalizes or lowers the authority of the court, b) prejudices or obstructs the due course of judicial proceedings, or c) interferes or obstructs the administration of justice in any other way constitutes criminal contempt. 32 </span>

The Supreme Court further declared in Sukhdev‘s case 34 that a High Court can deal with a contempt case summarily and use its own procedure that is consistent with fair play and natural justice, rather than following the procedure outlined in the CRPC or the Contempt of Courts Act 1971. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2596 2117 2906">As a court of record a High Court has the power to review and correct its own judgments, orders or decisions even though there is no explicit provision in the constitution which states that High Court has power to review its own decision. But the Supreme Court has ruled that high courts being a Superior Court have the inherent power to review their judgment. In order to prevent miscarriage of justice and to </span>
