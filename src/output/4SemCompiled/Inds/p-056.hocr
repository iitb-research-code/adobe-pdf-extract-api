          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 307 2118 683">ground that the Election Commission is becoming less and less independent of the Executive than in the earlier years of Independence, because the choice of the Chief Election Commissioner has not always been based on criteria, which would command the confidence of all sections of public opinion. The practice of making it a berth for retiring Government officials has, perhaps, been responsible for the feeling that the incumbent so benefitted will be beholden to the Government for his office.‖ 60 </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 703 2117 1212">Some of the limitations of the office of Election Commission are: The Constitution has not debarred the retiring election commissioners from any further appointment by the government and The Election Commission members' qualifications (legal, educational, administrative, or judicial) are not specified in the Constitution. The Vohra Committee report (Government of India, ‗Vohra Committee Report on Criminalization of Politics, Ministry of Home Affairs‘ (1993) pointed to the rapid growth of criminal networks that had in turn developed an elaborate system of contact with bureaucrats, politicians and media persons. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1288 2117 1741">244th Law Commission of India Report: The Law Commission of India submitted its report on February 24, 2014, Electoral Disqualifications to the Ministry of Law and Justice. The study comes in response to a Supreme Court order made in December 2013 in the Public Interest Litigation filed by the NGO Public Interest Foundation, which sought to decriminalize politics. The report examined issues related to: (i) disqualification of candidates with criminal background, and (ii) consequences of filing false affidavits. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1827 2117 2005">Key recommendations include: Stage at which disqualification is to be triggered The Commission examined the different stages at which disqualification may be triggered, and decided upon the stage of framing of charges. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2092 2118 2270">Conviction: Due to significant delays in trials and few convictions, the current approach of disqualification upon conviction has failed to prevent the criminalization of politics. To be an effective deterrent, the law must develop. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2356 2117 2534">Filing of police report: There is no application of judicial mind during the filing of the police report. As a result, this is not the appropriate time to impose disqualification. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2621 2117 2799">Framing of charges: The stage of framing of charges is based on adequate levels of judicial scrutiny. By effecting disqualification at this stage, with adequate safeguards, the spread of criminalization of politics may be curbed. </span>
