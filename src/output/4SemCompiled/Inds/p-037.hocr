      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 505 2117 749">The emergence of the role and position of the chief minister had been explained in the context of a number of factors such as: Procedure of appointment, relation with the governor, relationship with political party in the state and at the Centre, relations with colleagues, programs and policies being pursued and the like. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 770 425 815">1. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 770 2118 1278">The procedure of appointment is clearly mentioned in the constitution, that is, the leader of the majority party in legislative assembly will be appointed as the chief minister in practice, and however, this procedure had not been strictly followed. There had been examples when the chief ministers had been nominated by the center or the party high command instructed the legislators to elect a particular person for the post of chief minister. For example in Punjab, Partap singh kairon had the support of Jawaharlal Nehru and Manohar Lal khattar is the one of the favorite of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 1299 2118 2270">Another grave issue that has been noticed is the involvement of the central government, not only in the appointment of the chief minister but also extended to the formation, reshuffle and dismissal of the ministers and allocation of portfolios. Generally, the chief minister has to prepare the list of the council of minister consultation with the high command. He has to accommodate such persons who are not of his liking and these people become a headache for him thus ultimately chief minister‘s style of working is determined on the basis of his interaction with these ministers. They become dissidents and often create hurdles in the smooth functioning of the state administration. Sometime their differences are exposed publically. But for the survival, the chief minister has to please the high command and yield before their pressure. Presently Captain Amrinder Singh‘s Government faced this problem and due to some issues he have to resign and High Command appoints the new Chief Minister and reshuffles the cabinet and new President of Punjab Congress. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 2290 2118 2865">The Governor of the state appoints the members of the council of minister on the advice of the chief minister. In this regard, regional and local pressures also affect the chief minister‘s choice. Besides, same representation in the council of ministers has to be provided to women, members of scheduled castes, Minorities, and Backward classes. Above all, the wishes of the high command of the ruling party whose approval in the formation of state ministry has become an accepted practice. Therefore, the chief minister is not totally free to choose his team purely on considerations of the political and administrative ability of his colleagues in state legislature. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 2885 2117 3129">The politics of coalition had heralded a number of notable changes in the institutional functioning of the office of chief minister. The nature of the role of governor, the position of the chief minister, the mode of functioning of chief minister and the outlook and working style of the bureaucracy, during </span>
