      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 415 2118 1320">Regionalism is a major factor in Indian politics like communalism, casteism, religion, linguism etc. Regionalism has been traditionally present Indian Politics and the federal structure was governed by this factor. However its emergence as a negative factor of Indian Politics has been a post 1947 phenomenon. Constitution makers were very much aware about this and to keep under control the forces of regionalism, they preferred to adopt the unitary spirit with federal structure which called Quasi Federal System. Not unitary like China and Britain neither federal like United States of America. The mixed system was considered a desirable means for channelizing regional forces into the national main stream. Unfortunately, however, the system has not been successful in producing desired results. The emergence and increase of demands for separate independent states out of India, full statehoods has also been demanded for different areas, as well as demands for regional autonomy, and advocacy of regional interests over and above the national interests. All these interests reflect the presence of strong and even dirty and narrow regionalism. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1384 759 1428">9.6.1. MEANING </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1490 2118 2262">To understand regionalism, it is necessary to understand various dimensions of the region. Region as a geographical unit, is delimited form each other. Region as a social system, reflects the relation between different human beings and groups. Regions are an organized cooperation in cultural, economic, political or military fields. Region acts as a subject with distinct identity, language, culture and tradition. Regionalism in its positive sense, It means someone‘s love for an area where he is living or a particular region which one belongs. It is something natural. To protect and promote the interest of their state is very much natural phenomenon like Punjabi people love and adore their culture, religion, food and their attire. To secure the interest of their state and identity is a natural objective before all inhabitants. If they want to explore these things, nothing is wrong in it. This type of regionalism has to be accepted as a natural feature of Indian Federalism. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2325 2118 2965">In the negative sense, which is prevalent in the present scenario, Regionalism means love for one‘s own region over and above the interests of other regions or nation as a whole. In this point of view, region is taken to mean a particular territorial area whose inhabitants have close cultural, Socio-economic, linguistic, Historical, Religious and various other links among them and who considered themselves distinct, different from other areas. When people raised narrow and parochial issues which are against the national interest and also opposed the interest of peoples of other regions, it is equivalent to negative and aggressive regionalism. It poses a big threat to the unity and integrity of the nation and weakens the strength of nation as well. </span>
