Again in 1998, NDA-I introduced the bill without any success. Thereafter, the Bill lapsed and was reintroduced – in 1999, in 2002 and 2003. UPA-I government, led by Congress, again introduced the bill to reserve seats for women in Lok Sabha and legislative assemblies in May 2008. After its reintroduction, the bill was passed by Rajya Sabha on March 9, 2010, but was still left pending in Lok Sabha. A few regional parties like and RJD Samajwadi Party (SP) has been one of the vocal opponents for the Women‘s Reservation Bill. </span>

The Constitution of India guarantees equality for both men and women and the participation of women is crucial in the policy formulation and regulation as they represent nearly half of total population. They could act as role model for women empowerment and could bring behavioural change in the society towards the women. More policies relating to women‘s safety, education, child care, MMR, child marriage, domestic violence etc can be framed if women are involved in decision making owing to their emotional quotient towards these issues.  </span>

In the absence of gender equality and women empowerment, human rights remain in an inaccessible realm. Patriarchal society confines women to the four walls of domestic life and prohibiting them from process of decision making. Representation in parliament and state legislative assemblies is low. Women‘s representation in the Lok Sabha is merely 14%. Normally Women candidates who generally win elections are used as proxy by male members in their family. In many villages of Uttar Pradesh, where women are chiefs of village Panchayat, their husbands introduce themselves as ‗pradhan pati‟ (husband of the Panchayat chief). It is common all over India.  </span>
