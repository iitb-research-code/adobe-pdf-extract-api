The Governor does not have the power to pardon the above mentioned types of convicts, like the President does. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 560 2118 1542">In K.M. Nanavati v. State of Bombay 5 , the petitioner was convicted of murder and was sentenced to for life by the Bombay High Court. The petitioner at that point of time was in naval custody, and soon after the judgment by the High Court, the petitioner made an application for leave to appeal to Supreme Court. On the same day the Governor issued an Order under Article 161 suspending the sentence subject to this that the accused shall remain in the Naval Jail till the disposal of his appeal by the Supreme Court. The warrant issued for the arrest of the accused was returned unserved. The question involved was: Should the accused surrender to his sentence as required by the rules of the Supreme Court under Order XXI, Rule 5 or should remain in naval custody pursuant to the order made by the Governor under Art. 161. The Court held that the power to suspend a sentence by the Governor under Art.161 was subject to the rules of the Supreme Court with respect to cases which were pending before it in appeal. The power of the Governor to suspend the sentence of a convict was bad in so much as it came in conflict with the rule of the Supreme Court which required the petitioner to surrender himself to his sentence. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1563 2118 2071">It is open to the Governor to grant a full pardon at any time even during the pendency of the case in the Supreme Court in exercise of what is ordinarily called mercy jurisdiction. But the Governor cannot exercise his power of suspension of sentence for the period when the Supreme Court is seized of the case. The order of the Governor could only operate until the matter became sub judice in the Supreme Court and it did become so on filing of the petition for special leave to appeal. After the filing of such a petition and till the judicial process is over the power of the Governor cannot be exercised. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2290 2118 3063">Article 213 of the Constitution enables the Governor of a state to promulgate an ordinance if either House of state (or the legislative assembly, if a state only has one house) is not in session and ―circumstances exist, which render it necessary for him to take immediate action‖. Every ordinance has to be laid before the legislative assembly, and ceases to exist six weeks from the end of the next sitting of the assembly. Ordinance-making power is not a new feature added to the Indian Constitution. Articles 42 and 43 of the Government of India Act, 1935, gave the same power to the Governor General. Members of the Constituent Assembly, having experience of abuse of such power, were understandably wary of including the same in the Constitution. Both Hriday Nath Kunzru and Professor K.T. Shah called for restricting the executive‘s power to promulgate ordinances through greater oversight by legislatures. They were, however, overruled by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who stated that </span>
