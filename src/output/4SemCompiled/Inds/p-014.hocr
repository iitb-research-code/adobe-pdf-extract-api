      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2118 947">Ordinances are, however, framed by the executive, which is a single, unified entity. The President or the Governor (in the States) is the head of the executive who acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers when promulgating ordinances. Under our constitutional scheme the Council of Ministers shares collective responsibility. In addition, ordinances are only to be promulgated when it is ―necessary to take immediate action‖. There is then no great difficulty in ascertaining the motives of the President or the Governor when an ordinance is promulgated to meet an immediate situation. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 968 2118 1476">The Supreme Court has slowly been compelled to move in this direction as well. D.C. Wadhwa v. State of Bihar 10 relates to the State of Bihar promulgating and re-promulgating ordinances on a ―massive scale‖. Between 1967 and 1981, as many as 256 ordinances were promulgated and re-promulgated, and some of them continued in existence this way for up to 14 years. In pronouncing its judgment the Supreme Court departed from the above-mentioned precedent and went into the relevant governmental information preceding the promulgation and re-promulgation of these ordinances. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1497 2118 1807">The power of review over ordinances was implicitly taken one step further in 1998 in the case of Krishna Kumar Singh v.State of Bihar 11 , where the court struck down a number of ordinances, stating that no basis for the exercise of ordinance-making power had been shown. It stated explicitly: ―There is also no explanation offered for promulgating one ordinance after another.‖ </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1827 2117 2005">Though the sheer profligacy in ordinance-making compelled the Supreme Court to start performing some sort of judicial review, there is as of now no clarity on the nature and extent of judicial review over ordinance-making. </span>
