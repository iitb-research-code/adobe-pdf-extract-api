To win elections, every candidate and party must gain the support of more than one caste and group. No political party ever receives the votes of all members of a caste or group. Candidates from the same caste may be fielded by multiple political parties. Many voters have no candidates from their caste, while others have multiple candidates from their community. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 745 2118 1452">Unlike India, Nepal does not have any reservations or quotas in political entities, civil service jobs, or higher education institutions. Lower castes are significantly underrepresented in government, although accounting for more than 20% of the population. Since 1958, just fourteen Dalits have been elected to Nepal's parliament (upper house) through a nomination procedure, all of whom are men. In the House of Representatives, only one Dalit has been elected. 94 In addition, Dalits are underrepresented in Nepal's administrative and judicial systems, and discrimination still exists in the Nepal Royal Army. 95 According to an NGO research on prejudice against Dalits in Nepal, Brahmins make up 57 percent of parliament and 89 percent of the judiciary, although accounting for only 16 percent of the population. As a result, one-fifth of Nepal's population is effectively marginalized. 96 </span>
