          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 308 1686 353">13. LACK OF CONTINUOUS CONTACT WITH MASSES: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2118 815">Another feature of Indian Political Party system is that Political parties do not keep a continuous contact with masses. Almost, all political parties become active only during elections and after elections are over, they also disappear. These parties do not continuously propagate their policies and programmes among the people. As a result, public grows indifferent to political problems and stops taking interest in political affairs. As a result, they do not get proper political training. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 903 1463 948">14. FACTIONALISM IN POLITICAL PARTIES: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1034 2117 1476">There is factionalism in almost all the political parties of India. Factionalism harms the unity of the party for the fulfilment of personal interests. Factionalism, defections, splits, mergers, fragmentation, polarisation and so on have been an important aspect of the functioning of political parties in India. Lust for power and material considerations have made the politicians to leave their party and join another party or start a new party. This phenomenon caused political instability both at the centre and in the states and led to disintegration of the parties. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1564 1945 1610">15. ELECTORAL ALLIANCES AND COALETION GOVERNMENTS: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1695 2117 2270">Because of Multi-party system and lack of ideological committment, many political parties strike electoral alliances. Such alliances have been formed by different parties at local and national levels. In 1977, five national parties made an alliance to fight against the Congress and won victory in the elections and afterwards formed Janta Party. Similarly during the state legislative assembly elections, different political parties formed alliances, politics. Today, there are two main alliances in the centre. United Progressive Alliance-UPA is being led by the Congress party and National Democratic Alliance-NDA is being led by BJP and both these alliances have formed governments in the centre from time to time. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2357 2029 2403">16. COMMUNAL AND CASTE CHARACTER OF POLITICAL PARTIES: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2489 2117 2997">In India, many political parties are organised a caste and communal basis. These parties try to win the political support of the people on religion and caste basis. The names worth mentioning in this regard are those of Hindu Mahasabha, Muslim League, Akali Dal, Muslim United Front, Shiv Sena, Bahujana Samaj Party, D.M.K., and AIDMK, Republican Party and Jharkhand party. The parties organised on caste and communal basis arouse religious and caste feelings and emmity among people belonging to different religions and castes and many times cause communal riots in the name of religion and caste. Such riots harm the national unity. </span>
