However, the population's wide range of caste identity made it impossible to neatly fit colonial or Brahman doctrine. During the mid-nineteenth century, colonizers developed or manufactured Indian social identities based on categories of convenience. This was done to fulfil the aims of the British Indian administration, which included the creation of a single society with a common law that could be readily ruled. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 811 2118 1320">A vast and complicated diverse system of faiths and social identities was consolidated to a degree that has likely never been seen before in world history, entirely new classes and caste systems were created, inconsistent or distorted parts were stuffed together, new limits were formed, and adjustable boundaries were compressed. In British India, religion-based electorates and caste-based reservations made ambiguous groups solid, whereas, in independent India, caste-based reservations made ambiguous categories comprehensive. There were actual and tangible repercussions to belonging to one category rather than the other. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1490 2118 1932">India is the world's largest democracy, with a population of over a billion people and an electorate of a little over 671 million people in the last election in 2004. ‗Indian democracy‘ carries on working despite poverty, illiteracy, corruption, religious nationalism, casteism, political violence, and disregard for law and order. 88 Two sorts of politics may be identified in any emerging political system: the politics of thought and the polities of action. One can gain valuable insight into the nature and direction of political change in such a system. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1994 2117 2635">A person's socialization is influenced by the beliefs and interests of his/her caste. There are states like Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh that are extremely caste concerned when they are recruiting the people in their political parties. There are numerous caste-based political parties in India, each attempting to promote and safeguard the interests of a specific caste. The caste issue, in particular, has a strong influence on regional political groups. 89 DMK and AIADMK are non-Brahmin political parties from Tamil Nadu. All political parties in India use caste as a means for securing votes in elections. BSP banks upon the support of Scheduled Castes while the BJP largely banks upon its popularity among caste Hindu and the trading community. 90 </span>
