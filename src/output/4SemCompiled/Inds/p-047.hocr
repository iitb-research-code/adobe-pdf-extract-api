      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 507 1258 552">4.4.2. POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 613 2117 1121">Judicial activism depends upon the power of the review courts in a country. India is a democratic country which keeps the right of the people supreme. Hence, to save the act of Legislature and Executive which infringes the Fundamental Rights is subject to the Judicial Scrutiny. For the same purpose, Article 13 provides that all the post and pre constitutional law must adhere to the basic scheme of the constitution which includes the rights of the persons. Judicial review is a tool in hands of judiciary to keep legislature in its bounds. The legislature can make no law which is ultra vires the basic constitutional principles and rule of law. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1142 2118 1386">Therefore, Judicial Review is inherently implied in our Constitution. Supreme Court has held in L Chandra Kumar v. Union of India 35 that Judicial Review is the basic structure of Indian Constitution. Thus, there is no doubt regarding the legitimacy of Judicial Review in Indian Constitution. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1406 2118 1915">The Supreme Court and High Courts of India have been given the authority to review any legislative, executive, or administrative decision taken by the government. No special court or tribunal can have the same powers as that of the High Courts and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has ruled that such tribunals cannot take the place of the High Court and Supreme Court's judicial review powers. 36 Therefore, it is the constitutional mandate which empowers the Supreme Court and High Courts to protect the rule of law in India. Article 13 and 226 of the Constitution explicitly provides for power of judicial review of High Court. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2003 1260 2048">4.4.3. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION  </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2109 2118 2882">Article 228 provides that if the High Court is satisfied that a case pending in a subordinate Court involves a substantial question of law regarding the interpretation of the Constitution, which it is necessary to determine to dispose of the case, the High Court shall withdraw the case to itself. It may then dispose of the whole case itself, or may determine only the constitutional law point and return the case to the subordinate Court for disposal in conformity with the High Courtâ€˜s judgment on the constitutional point. The High Court will take action under Art. 228 only if the case cannot be disposed of without determining the constitutional question involved. This provision enables the High Court to determine the constitutional question at the earliest opportunity. The language of Article 228 is such that once the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied; the High Court has no option but to withdraw the case to itself for disposal. </span>
