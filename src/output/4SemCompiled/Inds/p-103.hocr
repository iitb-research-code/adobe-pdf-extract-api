      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 700 2117 1407">Caste and Religion is the most ancient feature of the Indian societal system. The caste system that exists in Indian civilization is well-known around the world. The system, on the other hand, has degenerated in modern times. It was thought that after independence, the system would gradually disintegrate and have very little consequence because it was not mentioned in the constitution. Discrimination based on caste or creed is, in fact, illegal and penalized. However, over time, it has become clear that caste continues to play an important role. It continues to play an important part in all aspects of political life. Its impact is felt on all levels whether it is national, state, or local. However, caste often exerts a significant impact on the political system, with those influenced by caste refusing to vote for the most qualified candidate who does not belong to their caste. </span>

Politics has been dominated by promoting communalism and casteism. The existence of many groups tied to a caste or religion is viewed as a source of social diversity and inequities in our country. The constitution was established with the sole purpose to bring unity and integrity among all the people of the nation so that they can live with peace and harmony. Many provisions were laid down for the upliftment of the lower caste so that they should also get equal opportunities and can get rid of all the atrocities and can get equal status as everyone. According to some of the surveys that were conducted by NGOs, there exist several political parties that solely win on the existence of the caste and religion system. Amongst all these the poor population of the country is the most vulnerable among all and they can be influenced by even the smallest of the promises doesn‘t matter they are fake or not. Because Indian society is largely fragmented along caste, religion, class, and other categories, the real functioning of Parliamentary democracy is hampered. The basic objective of this chapter is to analyze the role of caste and religion in Indian politics and how it is the cause of worries in a democratic nation like India and what are the main reasons behind these that they are promoted by the political parties. </span>
