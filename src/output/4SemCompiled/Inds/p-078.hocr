But the Akali Dal was not satisfied with this reorganisation because most of the Punjabi-speaking areas were not included into Punjab. Chandigarh was made a Union Territory, the management of Bhakra Nangal was not entrusted to Punjab and injustice was done to Punjab regarding the distribution of river waters. The Akali Dal started a 'Dharam Yudh Morcha' against the Central Government on August 4, 1982 which came to an end with the signing of 'Rajiv-Longowal Agreement'. On August 24, 1985, Shriomani Akali Dal has been generally accepted as the party of the Sikhs because alongwith the demands of the Punjabis, the party has been raising the demands of Sikh Community. Because of this, some critics labeled Akali Dal as a communal party. But the Shromani Akali Dal headed by S. Prakash Singh Badal has opened its doors for other communities to make the organisation an all inclusive outfit. While restricting the party, S. Badal made wide ranging changes to give representation to Dalits, women and the youth as a result which it has got the look of a Punjabi Party. </span>
