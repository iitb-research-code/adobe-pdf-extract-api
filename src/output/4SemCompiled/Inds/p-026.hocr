      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 307 2119 484">Prior consent of the President of India for introduction of some Bills: There are certain bills which can be introduced in a state legislature only with the prior consent of the President of India. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 536 2118 1055">Reservation of bills by the Governor for Presidentâ€™s Assent: There are certain bills, which after having been passed by the state legislature, can be reserved by the Governor for the consent of the President. Such bills become laws only after the President has given his assent. (3) Limitation that can be imposed by the Rajya Sabha: The Union Parliament gets the power to pass laws on the State List, (for one year) if the Rajya Sabha adopts a resolution (supported by 2/3rd majority of the members present and voting) and declares a state subject mentioned in the resolution as a subject of national importance. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1117 2117 1361">Limitations during national Emergency: When a national emergency (Under Art. 352) is in operation, the Parliament is empowered to pass a law on any subject of the State List. The law so passed operates during the period of emergency and for six months after the end of the emergency. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1424 2118 1667">Limitations during a Constitutional Emergency: During the operation of constitutional emergency in a state under Art 356, the Union Parliament gets the authority of making laws for that state.

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1730 2118 1974">Discretionary Powers of the Governor: Discretionary powers of the Governor of a state also constitute a limitation on the State Legislature. Whenever he acts in his discretion, he is beyond the jurisdiction of the State Legislature. Acting in his discretion, the Governor can even dissolve the State Legislative Assembly. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2036 2118 2412">Precedence of Union Laws on the Concurrent Subject: They State Legislature and the Union Parliament, both have the concurrent power to make laws on the subjects of the Concurrent List. If both the Union Parliament and a State Legislature pass a law on the same subject of the Concurrent List and there is inconsistency between the two, the law passed by the Union Parliament gets precedence over the corresponding state law. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2474 2118 2784">Thus, each state legislature in India exercises law-making powers over the subjects given to it by the Constitution. However, even in respect of these, it exercises lawmaking powers under the above constitutional limitations. Nevertheless, in general the State Legislatures act as important and powerful legislatures in all the 28 States and 2 Union Territories of India. </span>
