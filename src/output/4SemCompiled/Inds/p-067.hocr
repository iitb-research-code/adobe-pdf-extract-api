          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 308 1466 353">9. LACK OF IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENT: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2118 1080">Another significant feature of the Indian Party system is the lack of ideological and principle commitment. Ideological commitment means firm faith in a particular political, social and economic ideology and collective efforts to achieve it. But in India, most of the political parties are opportunist and they sacrifice their principles for the fulfilment of their narrow interests. In India, coalition governments are the product of this opportunism. For the lack of ideological commitment, this party could not preserve its unity and stability and was soon divided into 4 parts. The government of National Democratic Alliance, which was formed under leadership of Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 13th October 1999, was based on the co-operation of 23 political parties. There was a lot of difference in the political ideology of these parties. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1299 2117 1807">Another significant feature of the Indian Party System is the emergence of a large number of regional parties and their growing role. Among the regional political parties Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab, DMK, ADMK and Tamila Manila Congress in Tamil Nadu, Telgu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, Assam Gana Parishad in Assam, Kerala Congress and Muslim League in Kerala, Trinamool congress in West Bengal, Rashtriya Janta Dal in Bihar, Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh & Mizo National Front in Mizoram are worth mentioning. There regional political parties have played an important role at the national level. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1895 991 1940">11. PERSONALITY CULT: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2026 2117 2468">Before independence our social, political and economic set-up was based on feudal values but this set up did not witness any specific change after the attainment of independence. Even today, aristocrates and elites exercise their control over politics and political parties. People have a strong feeling of personality worship. They have more faith in the leader of the party than ideology of the party. At the time of elections, votes are asked let in the name of the party but in the name of the leader of the party and people are requested to strengthen in the hands of a leader. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2556 1332 2601">12. LACK OF PROPER ORGANISATION: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2687 2117 2997">Organisation is the life and soul of Political Parties. In our country, the organisation of Political parties is not based democratic principles. The low level cadres of all political parties are not independent in their decision making. They have to work seeking instruction from the High command of the parties. Most of the Political parties follow this rule. </span>
