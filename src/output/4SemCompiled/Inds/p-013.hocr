According to him, the only solution was to ―…confer upon the President the power to promulgate a law which will enable the executive to deal with that particular situation because it cannot resort to the ordinary process of law…‖ when the legislature was not in session. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2118 1278">It is clear that the framers of the Constitution envisaged ordinance-making powers only for unforeseen, sudden situations and where the executive required additional legal sanction to address the situation. The executive, however, decided to completely disregard this requirement of necessity for immediate action. According to data furnished in the Statistical Handbook of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, more than 41 ordinances were promulgated during the term of the first Lok Sabha itself. Indeed, in the pre-Indira Gandhi period, that is, before 1966, more than 75 ordinances were passed by the Central government. The necessity of taking immediate action by promulgating ordinances has remained debatable at best through the years. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1497 2118 2666">Courts have uniformly held, in varying formulations, that the power of the President and the Governors to issue ordinances is in the nature of an emergency power. In A.K. Roy v. Union of India 6 and R.C. Cooper v. Union of India 7 (Bank nationalisation case), the Supreme Court said that ordinance-making power was a legislative power given to the President and was not similar to the exercise of his executive powers. As such, ordinances are also ―law‖ under Article 13. Using the same reasoning, the Supreme Court reached damaging conclusions in Venkata Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh 8 and K. Nagaraj and Ors. V. State of Andhra Pradesh 9 . In Venkata Reddy, the constitutional validity of the Andhra Pradesh Abolition of Posts of Part-time Village Officers Ordinance, 1984, was challenged. One of the grounds of challenge was that the ordinance was void on account of the lack of application of mind by the Governor. The court asked itself the question whether ―the validity of an ordinance can be tested on grounds similar to those on which an executive or judicial action is tested‖. In answering the question it cited its earlier judgment in K. Nagaraj and held that since promulgating an ordinance was a legislative action, the grounds on which it could be challenged were the same as those on which laws made by Parliament could be challenged. The ―motives of the legislature in passing a statute is beyond the scrutiny of courts‖. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2687 2118 2931">That the motives of the legislature are not gone into when the validity of a law is considered is a settled principle in law. It is a settled principle because it is difficult to ascribe a single, clear motive for the enactment of a law to the entire legislative body. Members of the same legislature may support (or oppose) the enactment of a </span>
