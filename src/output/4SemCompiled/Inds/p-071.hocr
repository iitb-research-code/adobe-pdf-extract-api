      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2117 551">Democracy, Secularism, Socialism and Non-alignment are the main elements of Congress (I) ideology. The brief description is as follows: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 572 815 618">1. DEMOCRACY: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 703 2118 1013">The Congress (I) was deep faith in democracy. Democracy is the foundation of Indian Constitution. It is embedded in Indian Institutions and has an indelible imprint on the heart of mind of the Indian People. Liberty, Equality and justice are the basic elements of democracy. The Congress has strengthened these elements by its policies and programmes. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1101 1051 1147">2. FAITH IN SECULARISM: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1232 2117 1609">Secularism is an important element of Congress (I) ideology. According to the election manifesto of Congress (I), Secularism is the basis of the Indian Nationalism. In India secularism does not mean opposition to religion or irreligiousness. In secularism man has the freedom to worship and reach but the state has no religion of its own. It prohibits discrimination and partiality of any kind against any citizen on the basis of religion. </span>

The objective of Congress (I) is to establish socialistic society. Pt. Nehru was of the firm view that except for socialism there is no other way to do away the poverty and wide spread unemployment of the Indian people. Under Mrs. Indira Gandhi's leadership, the word 'socialist' was incorporated in the Preamble to Indian Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional amendment. By passing National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, the UPA Government being lead by the Congress Party has provided to provide 100 days work in a year to every unemployment person living in villages. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2490 1097 2535">4. ECONOMIC LIBERALISM: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2621 2117 3195">During the last few years, Congress has left behind the objective of socials and adopted the policy of 'Economic Liberalism' or 'Open Market'. After coming into power in June 19, 1991 the Narsimaha Rao Government of Congress declared open and liberal economic policies. Most of the controls and restrictions imposed on industry and trade were withdrawn. Leaving some industries, license system has been finished on other industries. Instead of Public sector, private sector has been given priority and privalization of industries is being encouraged. Full freedom has been given to import foreign capital and technology.
