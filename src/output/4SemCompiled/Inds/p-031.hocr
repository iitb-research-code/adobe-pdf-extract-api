When a political party or combination of political parties secures a stable majority in the assembly, the role of the governor in appointing the chief minister is only formal and noncontroversial. However, if no single political party enjoys a clear cut majority, his role assumes much importance. The governor can exercise same discretion in the matter of appointing the chief minister. Under such circumstances the governor is not bound to appoint the leader of single largest party in the legislative assembly. In such a situation he may invite the leader of the largest single party in legislature to form the government, irrespective of the fact whether such a party commands a stable majority on the floor of the house. He may appoint a person about whose capacity he is satisfied that he commands a stable majority in the legislature. No single formula prevails with the governor and the governor took different stand in different states under similar circumstances. In case the governor finds out that no party secures a majority and there are also no chances of post electoral coalitions, then the governor may recommend for the imposition of half state emergency, but this action is controversial. This happened when the U.P governor, in 1970, advised the president to invoke article 356 when he dismissed the Charan Singh ministry on the plea that the congress had withdrawn their support from BKD led ministry. Then he invited T.N Singh to form another coalition ministry soon after. Even a full-fledged emergency can be imposed if the governor is sure that no stable government is possible. </span>
