          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 308 1293 353">4.4.4. POWER OF SUPERINTENDENCE </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 415 2118 923">High Court has the power of Superintendence over the courts and tribunals in the state within its jurisdiction. The power of Superintendence conferred by Article 227 is in addition to the power conferred under Article 226. It is in some ways wider than the power and jurisdiction under Article 226. 37 The aim of supervisory jurisdiction is to keep the subordinate courts and tribunals within the limits of their authority and ensuring that they obey law. 38 The grounds of interference could be want or excess of jurisdiction, 39 failure to exercise jurisdiction, 40 violation of principles of natural justice41 or an error Apparent on the face of record. 42 </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 943 2119 1452">Whenever the high court exercises this power it does not act as an appellate Court but it has a supervisory jurisdiction. The power of superintendence under article 227 is of administrative as well as judicial nature 43 . It may also be exercised suo motu but it cannot be exercised to influence the subordinate Judiciary to pass any order or judgment in a particular manner. 44 The supervisory jurisdiction cannot be exercised in the case if any other remedy is available to the aggrieved party even though the pursuing of that remedy involves inconvenience or delay. 45 This power can be exercised in those cases in which no appeal or revision lie to the High Court. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1541 876 1585">4.4.5. JURISDICTION </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1646 2117 2155">A high court has a very wide jurisdiction, namely, original, appellate, supervisory and writ jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction means the power of high court to hear disputes in the first instance, not by way of appeal. It extends to some matters like: Matters of admiralty, conflict between state and the citizen, enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens, questions involving interpretation of constitution, revenue matters etc. A high court also exercises appellate jurisdiction. By this we mean it hears appeals against the judgments of subordinate courts. It hears appeals in both civil and criminal matters. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2217 2117 2461">A very significant aspect of the Indian Constitution is the jurisdiction it confers on the High Courts to issue writs. Article 226 of the Constitution empowers HC to issue certain writs which are Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Certiorari, Prohibition and Quo Warranto. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2513 2117 2701">Article 226 operates ―notwithstanding anything in article 32.‖ Thus, Article 32 and Article 226 exist in their own right. Article 226 has a wider scope than Article 32. The Supreme Court can only issue writs for the enforcement of Fundamental </span>
