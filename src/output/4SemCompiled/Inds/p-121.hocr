      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 415 2118 989">Regionalism plays major role in Indian Politics. It is a big hurdle in the process of national integration and nation building. It continues to plague Indian political system in various forms. Roots of regionalism is in Indiaâ€˜s multiple variety of languages, cultures, ethnic groups, communities, religions and so on, and encouraged by the regional concentration of those identity markers, and fueled by a sense of regional deprivation. For many centuries, India remained the land of many lands, regions, cultures and traditions. Regionalism has remained the most convincing power in Indian politics ever since independence. It has remained the main basis of many regional political parties which have governed many states since the late 1960s. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1052 1857 1098">1. DEMAND FOR REGIONAL AUTONOMY WITHIN A STATE: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1159 2119 1601">Some states of India demands autonomy and their people are agitating continuously for the cause. India has variety of cultures, languages, and religions which make the people different from each other. Their distinctiveness makes them aware about their identity and they want to end all types of injustice which they feel due to their uniqueness. The genesis of such demands lies in the regional imbalances resulting from an uneven development of some part of some states. In West Bengal, the Gorkhaland demand was based on this principle. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1665 2117 1776">2. DEMANDS FOR SEPARATE STATEHOOD WITHIN THE INDIAN TERRITORY: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1837 2117 2147">After the reorganization of states in 1956, there still continues to be demand for separate statehood in various parts of the country. The rising number of states from 16 in 1956 to 28 states at present tends to confirm this statement. In 1966, Punjab was reorganized into Punjabi speaking Punjab, Hindi speaking Haryana and Hilly areas into Himachal Pradesh. Like Punjab many other states get their statehood.  </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2212 2114 2256">3. INTER- STATE DISPUTES AS A MANIFESTATION OF REGIONALISM: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2318 2118 2892">The forces of regionalism in India are also visible in the inter-state disputes. For example, the State of Punjab and Haryana still involved in dispute over the issue of transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab and certain areas like Abohar and Fazlika to Haryana. The boundary disputes between Karnatka and Kerala on Kasargod, Rangma reserved forests in Rangapani Area is the matter of dispute between Asam and Nagaland, Hakumari and Jingiran river areas of Garo hills is an issue of clash between Assam and Meghalaya and so on. Dispute over River water between different states reflects regionalism. The states which are parties to these disputes act under the influence of regionalism and each wants to gain over and above the other. </span>
