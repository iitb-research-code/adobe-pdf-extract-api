According to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (1996-1997 and 1997-1998) reports, 54 percent of the Central Government's scheduled caste reservation quota remains unfulfilled. In the public sector, more than 88 percent of open positions are empty, while 45 percent of open positions in state banks are unoccupied. 91 Brahmins made up 70% of the Class I officers in government services in 1989, although accounting for only 5% of the population. In universities, upper-castes hold 90 percent of social science teaching positions and 94 percent of science teaching positions, respectively, whereas Dalit representation is only 1.2 and 0.5 percent. </span>

While India is the world's largest democracy, democracy has been a charade for many of its Dalit residents. Many people are often harassed and beaten by political party strongmen during elections to force them to vote for specific candidates. Dalit peasants who refuse to cooperate have already been harassed, beaten, and murdered by local landlords and police authorities. Dalit voters have also been punished by the police and upper-caste militias acting on the orders of influential political leaders in India's states. Police stormed a Dalit community in Tamil Nadu in February 1998 after it boycotted the national parliamentary elections. Women were assaulted and beaten, and cops pushed sticks and iron pipes into their mouths. </span>

During Bihar's 1995 state election campaign, the Ranvir Sena, a private militia of upper-caste landlords, was responsible for the deaths of more than fifty individuals. During the national parliamentary elections in February 1998, the Sena was used to frighten voters in Ara district, Bihar. 92 Dalits who ran for political office in village councils and municipalities through seats that were constitutionally "reserved" for them have been threatened with physical assault and even death in an attempt to get them to drop out of the race. Following the election of a Dalit to the village council presidency in Melavalavu, Tamil Nadu's Madurai district, members of a higher-caste group murdered six Dalits in June 1997, including the elected council president, who was beheaded. 93 </span>

Political parties consider the caste composition of their voters when selecting candidates. Voters in many places vote based on caste and fail to select suitable candidates. When a government is formed following elections, political parties ensure that members of various castes are represented. During elections, political parties raise caste-based issues to obtain support. Until now, the castes considered lower have been marginalized. In the </span>
