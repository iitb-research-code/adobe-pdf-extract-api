With the purpose to strengthen election campaign he made his sister Prinka Gandhi Vadra the General Secretary of the party. But inspite of the best efforts put in by both brother and sister, the party was able to win only 52 seats of Lok Sabha. The Congress Party suffered debacle in the elections of the 17th Lok Sabha continuously for second time. The party needs to do deep self introspection to come out of the president scenario. The party failed to win seats even in the states which had its governments. There is need to do vast organisational changes from top to bottom in the party. </span>
