In India, caste is a significant driver of political politics. When candidates are nominating from various constituencies, political parties consider the candidate's caste as well as the voter's caste in that constituency. As a result, this candidate will almost certainly receive votes from voters from his caste. Muslim candidates are deployed in Muslim-dominated electoral districts, while Jatt candidates are deployed in Jatt-dominated districts. Even secular parties like the Congress, Janata Dal, CPI, and CPM take caste into account when choosing candidates. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 943 2119 1650">The caste system and caste identities are influenced by politics because they are brought into the political arena. As a result, rather than politics becoming caste-ridden, caste becomes politicized. This can take several forms: for example, various caste groups are required to form coalitions with other castes or communities and thus engage in dialogue and negotiation, and new types of caste groups have emerged in the political arena, such as "backward" a caste group. In this way, caste politics has aided Dalits and OBCs in gaining greater access to decision-making. In a democracy, politics focused only on caste identity, is unhealthy. It has the potential to draw attention away from more urgent issues such as poverty, development, and corruption. Caste division can lead to tensions, conflict, and even violence in some circumstances. </span>
