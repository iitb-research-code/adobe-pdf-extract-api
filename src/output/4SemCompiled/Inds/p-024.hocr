      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 415 2117 658">An Amendment requires special majority of each House of the Parliament and ratification by not less than half of the States relating to Federal subjects. The resolution for the ratification is passed by State Legislatures with simple majority. However, a constitutional amendment cannot be initiated in the State Legislature. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 722 847 767">6. OTHER POWERS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 828 2118 1072">The state legislature considers the reports of the State Public Service Commission, State Auditor General, and others. It also acts as a forum for ventilation of the grievances of the people. The State Legislative Assembly has the right of adopting a resolution for the creation or abolition of the State Legislative Council. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1137 2117 1247">2.7. COMPARISON OF THE TWO HOUSES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1309 2118 1685">Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) like the Lok Sabha occupies a dominant position. Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) enjoys much less powers as compared to the powers of Vidhan Sabha even in relation to ordinary bills. The Rajya Sabha at the Centre enjoys equal powers in consideration of bills other than money bills; but Vidhan Parishad enjoys much lesser powers as compared to the Rajya Sabha. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1747 1893 1792">The relative position of the Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad is as under: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1849 1329 1905">ï‚· IN RELATION TO ORDINARY BILLS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1958 2118 3127">In case of the Parliament, if there is disagreement between the two Houses over an ordinary bill, the President summons a joint sitting of both the Houses and if the bill is passed there by the majority of votes, the bill is taken as passed by both Houses of the Parliament. But this provision of the joint sitting does not exist in the States. Although an ordinary bill can originate in either House of the State Legislature, yet both Houses have unequal powers. If a bill is passed in the Vidhan Sabha, it is transmitted to the Vidhan Parishad for consideration. When it is passed by Vidhan Parishad without any amendment, the bill is sent to the Governor for his assent. In case, the bill is (a) rejected by the Parishad or (b) more than three months elapsed without the bill being passed by the Parishad, or (c) bill is passed with amendment to which the Vidhan Sabha does not agree, the Vidhan Sabha may pass the bill again in the same or in the subsequent session. After that the bill is again sent to the Vidhan Parishad. If the Vidhan Parishad does not return the bill within a period of one month, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the State Legislature and is sent to Governor for his assent. Thus, the Vidhan Parishad can delay the bill for a maximum period of four months. On the other hand, if the bill is first passed by the Vidhan Parishad and rejected by the Vidhan Sabha, the bill is rejected and cannot become a law. </span>
