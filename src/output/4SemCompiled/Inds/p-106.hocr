          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 307 2118 881">social life has been governed by caste for generations, with each group maintaining a specific position in this complicated hierarchy. Rural communities have long been divided along caste lines; top and lower castes almost always resided in separate colonies, water wells were not shared, and Brahmins refused to eat or drink from Shudras. The system granted various privileges to the upper castes while legalizing favoured group's repression of the lower castes. 84 Several Dalits and other low-caste Indians have progressed to high positions in the country, including BR Ambedkar, the author of the Indian constitution, and KR Narayanan, the country's first Dalit president. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 943 2118 1584">According to historians, official caste divisions were of little relevance to Indians until the 18th century, social identities were considerably more flexible, and people could readily transfer from one caste to another. If we desire a secular society, however, we must cease identifying ourselves primarily by religion, caste, or language and begin to see ourselves as equal citizens of one nation, both in principle and in reality. This entails mutual obligations between the state and citizens, as well as between citizens, not only in principle but also in practice. Other identities, such as religion, caste, language, and geography, will gradually fade into the background. These must be changed to ensure that citizenship rights and the responsibilities that come with them remain paramount. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1754 2118 2659">The Indian caste system is thousands of years old and is mandated by Hinduism's sacred scriptures. Dalit students were usually confined to the back of the classroom. Entire villages in many Indian districts remain separated by caste in what has been labelled India's "hidden apartheid." 85 The state's provision of resources and amenities reinforces "untouchability," with different facilities provided for caste-based areas. The state authority builds power, sanitation facilities, and water pumps in upper-caste areas of numerous communities and they deliberately neglect the lower caste. 86 This was done in the early nineteenth century by bringing specific and handy Brahman-Sanskrit literature, such as the Manusmriti, to authoritative status; the Rig Veda's alleged origin of caste was most likely inserted retroactively after it was translated to English decades later. The census helped to establish these divisions in the mid-to late-nineteenth century. Through reading what they said were India's authoritative books, the colonizers created the accepted list of indigenous religions in India - Hinduism, Sikhism, and Jainism - as well as their boundaries and rules. </span>
