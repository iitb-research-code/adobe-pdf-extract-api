      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1432 1396 1477">3.5. POSITION OF THE CHIEF MINISTER: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1563 2117 1741">A look at the power of the chief minister shows that he has been vested with very extensive powers in the administration of the state. But in actual practice the chief minister of a state depends upon the following factors: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1761 425 1807">1. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 1761 2118 2005">Firstly, the position of the chief minister depends primarily upon his personality. If he is a person of integrity and has a dominating personality then he can be command great influence over state administration. It is rightly maintained that office is what the holder chooses to make it. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2026 425 2071">2. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 2026 2117 2468">Secondly, the position of the chief minister is partly determined by his relationship with the party in power in the Centre. If a chief minister has much influence in the Centre he can make the position of the state more influential in New Delhi, thereby enhancing his authority and power in the state. As democracy is meant government by parties, the chief minister of a state should have to please his central party organization. If the central organization of the party does not encourage him, his position in the state would be pre carious. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2489 425 2534">3. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 525 2489 2117 2799">Thirdly, the position of the chief minister considerably depends upon the support of the members of his party. If there are a number of dissidents in the party, they make his position ‗a bed of thorns‘. As long as he enjoys the confidence of the state legislature he is powerful. Once that confidence is withdrawn, no longer he continues to be the chief minister. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2819 2118 3195">Thus the position of chief minister is pre-eminent in the state government system. In, practice, his position will be imposing only when his party commands a clear majority in the state legislature. When it is a coalition government, it becomes difficult to safeguard the principle of collective responsibility also. Much of time and energy of the chief minister will, in that case, be wasted on keeping his team united and sufficiently disciplined. </span>
