      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 828 2118 1337">It is in the public interest for courts to exercise their constitutional duties impartially and efficiently. The public needs to be assured that judges act fairly, and are not under any kind of influence while deciding the cases. In K. Veeraswami v Union of India & Ors., 51 Justice Sharma said, ―The society's demand for a judge's honesty is high and unwavering. Judicial conduct, both on and off the bench, is usually held to exceedingly high standards. Deviating from such high standards of honesty and impartiality by a judge is a betrayal of the public's faith in him. No excuse or no legal relativity can condone such betrayal.‖ </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1399 2118 2040">Public criticism and public scrutiny of the judgments are also significant measures to check judiciary and make the judges accountable. If the fair criticism is not allowed then it would also violate an individual‘s right to speak fairly and freely. It is very important that the courts should recognize the right of the public to criticize the judgments as a fundamental freedom of speech. In D.C. Saxena v. Hon‟ble the Chief Justice of India,52 the Supreme Court recognized that administration of justice and judges are open to public scrutiny. The Court said, ―Judges have their accountability to the society and their accountability must be judged by the conscience and oath to their office, i.e. to defend and uphold the Constitution and the laws without fear and favour.‖ 53 </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2050 2117 2436">Thus, ―To keep the stream of justice clean and pure, the Judge must be endowed with sterling character, impeccable integrity and upright behaviour. Erosion thereof would undermine the efficacy of the rule of law and the working of the Constitution itself. In short, the behaviour of the Judge is the bastion for the people to reap the fruits of the democracy, liberty and justice and the antithesis rocks the bottom of the rule of law.‖ 54 </span>
