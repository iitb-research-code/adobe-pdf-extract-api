          <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 307 2118 815">fourth high court was established at Allahabad. With course of time, each province in the British India had its own separate High Court. The constitution provides for a high court for each state but the Seventh Amendment Act of 1956 authorized the parliament that it can establish a common High Court for two or more states or union territories. The Guhati High Court is a common High Court for four (originally seven) North eastern states namely, Mizoram, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh , The States of Punjab and Haryana also have a common High court which is also the High Court for Union Territory of Chandigarh. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 836 2117 947">Articles 214 to 231 in Part VI of the Constitution, deals with the organization, independence, jurisdiction and powers and procedures of High Courts. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1012 1292 1056">4.3. COMPOSITION OF HIGH COURTS </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1117 2118 1692">Every High Court consists of a Chief Justice and other judges appointed by the President of the country. The constitution does not specify any limit for the number of judges in High court and leaves it to the discretion of the president. The inadequacy of judicial strength leading to overburdening of judges and increasing pending cases is the embarrassing situation faced by each and every High Court. Thus the SC overruled its prior ruling in SP Gupta v. UOI 17 (also called First Judges Case) that the question of the strength of Judges in a High Court was not justiciable i.e. It is not for the Court to fix the number of judges itself but president is under the obligation to review the strength of each high court. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1767 2118 2287">In Supreme Court Advocates on-Record Association v. Union of India 18 it held that Chief Justice of India and Chief Justice of concerned High Court must undertake periodical review and send the recommendations to the President. If the president fails to act on such recommendation then the courts may order him to do so. The Court has emphasized that it is necessary to make a periodical review of the Judge strength of every High Court with reference to the felt need for disposal of cases, taking into consideration the backlog of cases and the expected future filing. Accordingly, the Court has ruled that fixation of Judge Strength in a High Court is a justiciable matter. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2376 1178 2420">4.3.1. APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2506 2118 2948">According to Article 217(1) of the Constitution, every High Court judge is appointed by the President of India in consultation with Chief Justice of India, Chief Justice of concerned state and Governor of the state. Since the executive is involved in the appointment process, it has always been thought provoking as to how we should ensure no favoritism i.e. judges are selected on non political considerations. The controversy was referred to various Commissions and finally came for determination before the court in Judgesâ€˜ case. 19 </span>
