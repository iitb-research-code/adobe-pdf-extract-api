      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 439 2118 1212">India is a federal country having 28 federating states along with the central government. Though our Constitution does not adhere to the theory of "Sons of the soil" but despite it some states have openly adopted it and are adhering to it. The theory of the "sons of the soil' means that a state gives preferential treatment to the natives of that state and sometimes government jobs are reserved only for the born people of those states. Indian politics has been listening to the slogans like "Maharashtra for Maharashtrains, Assam for Assamees, Tamil Nadu for Tamilians etc. Though such slogans have not been fully implemented by the states but in the minds of some people the seeds of regionalism have been sowed very deeply. It may explode at any time when the regional patriotism will over lake the national patriotism. It is a dangerous trend for the unity of India and it is most desirable that this evil should be ripped before it takes a serious term. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1497 2118 2137">With the passage of time a very encouraging trend is developing that the younger generation is getting disappointed with the performance of old generation in politics. The results of elections are indicating that the time is not very far when the young leaders will overtake the old leadership and the old political culture may give the place to newly developed integrated political culture. Sometimes it was a dream but now the emergence of youth leadership in every political party is an indication that the time is not very far when young leadership will come in and the old leadership will have to go out. In the elections, held recently in the various Legislative Assemblies of the states, a new indication has come to the forth that the old leadership is leaving the political power in favour of their sons and daughters. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2356 2118 3195">Whenever we come across with a sentence expressing that there is an end of ideology in India, it looks somewhat surprising and painful also. There would have been end of ideology in India if at all the ideology of any kind has ever been an outstanding characteristic of Indian Politics. Since the commencement of our Constitution some of the political parties like Congress, Communist Parties and some Socialist Parties use to clamor for their loyalty and adherence to some ideological principles. But these were merely theoretical principles which were often claimed by these parties as the basis of their formation. Whenever the opportunities came to them they sacrificed their declared ideology and practicing the opportunistic politics they captured political power. We mean to say that in India ideology has practically never been followed by the actors and players of the game of politics. Therefore, there does not see any logic to say that the end of ideology is an emerging trend of Indian politics. The fact of the matters is that Indian politics, as usual, has been and is devoid of ideological leanings </span>
