Such a slogan raised by political parties becomes more responsible for communalisation of politics. Religious minorities in India generally take support of religion also to get political benefits for the people. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 770 2119 1542">Indian politics is being communalised to a great extent. The Muslim community is the largest religious community in India and the Congress supports this community so that people of the Muslim community can become a vote-bank of the Congress. Several Hindu organisations treat this policy of the Congress as a policy of appeasement of minorities. The Samajvadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar and several other political parties often make political efforts to appease the Muslims so that they are able to get the maximum votes of this community. On the other hand, there is the Sangha Parivar that tries to excite Hindu communalism and oppose Muslim communalism. The then President of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Sh. Lal Krishna Advani visited Pakistan in June, 2005). In the elections of the 16th Lok Sabha, held in April-May, 2014 the factor of Hindutav played a great role in bringing together all shades of Hindus. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1631 1299 1676">23. DECLINE OF LEFTIST PARTIES </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1761 2118 2931">Sometimes before independence there arose a group of socialists within the Congress. After independence the socialists separated themselves from Congress and organized various Leftist Parties. The Communist Party of India (CPI) which came into existence in .1924 and the CPI (Marxist) came into being as a result of split of Communist Party of India. Other leftist parties were Parja Socialist, Sayyukta Samajvadi Party, Forwared Party and Republican but in the current scenario of Indian politics the leftist parties are not only declining rather they are becoming 'irrelevant in Indian politics. In a poor and backward country like India, the communist parties could not extend their support base throughout India, rather they we1e mainly confined to the States of Kerala and West Bengal. They had a little influence in Tripura, Assam and some other small eastern states. But at present the leftist parties do not find enough support from the people at large. They have supported Congress-led Central governments from time to time but they have never joined the government at all. In the States of Kerala and West Bengal they had been ruling-parties but in other states of India they had very nominal influence. With the adoption of new economic policies by the government of India the leftist parties have almost lost their relevance. In the elections of the 16th Lok Sabha the performance of the Leftist Parties was uninspiring. </span>
