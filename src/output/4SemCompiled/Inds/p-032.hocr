      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2118 947">The term of the chief minister is not fixed and he holds office during the pleasure of the governor.

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 968 2118 1212">The salary and allowances of the chief minister are determined by state legislature.

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1431 2118 1939">The powers and functions of the chief minister are similar to those of the prime minister at the Centre. The only difference lies in the jurisdiction over which they exercise their powers. The chief minister who is also the leader of the ruling party chooses the member of his council and allots portfolio to them, presides over all meetings and is the prime spokesman of the government. The chief minister holds a pivotal position in the state administration.

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1962 1380 2006">1. In Relation to the Council of Ministers:-</span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2092 2118 2600">It is the chief minister who heads the council of ministers in the state. As head of the council of ministers, he presides over the meeting of the cabinet. As a presiding officer, he greatly influences its deliberations and decisions. He controls the agenda of the cabinet meetings. It is he who seems to it that decisions are taken unanimously, because there the principle of collective responsibility is involved in it which means that mistake on the part of one minister can lead to the fall of the whole cabinet. The collective responsibility presupposes the existence of one leading member in the cabinet who can enforce the collective responsibility. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2689 1152 2734">2. In Relation to the Governor:-</span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2819 2117 3195">He is the connecting link between his council of ministers and the Governor. According to the Article 167, he is to communicate to the Governor the decisions of the ministers. He also provides the Governor with such information of the state affairs and proposal of legislation as the Governor may call for. If the governor so requires, the chief minister may place before the cabinet any matter where a decision has been taken by a minister without consulting his colleagues in the cabinet.
