      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 762 2118 1535">Women are seen as "home makers and care takers" and any deviance from this role is not acceptable in Indian society. Way forward providing quality education to women in the country and awareness about their rights and privileges as mentioned in the Constitution can only be ensured. Once women are appropriately educated, many problems eradicated automatically. Gender-based violence should be addressed on a priority basis to promote gender equality in the social and political arenas. It is imperative to strengthen National Mission of Empowerment of Women functioning and implementation. A critical mass of women in power can bring about transformation in leadership. Just like the recent success of women's movement to enter the sanctum sanctorum of Dargahs (religious places belong to Muslim Saints) and Temples, a similar movement needs to begin to increase women's participation in electoral politics.  </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1597 2117 2106">In the end it can be said that regionalism may be good or bad for a country. Constitution of India under Article-19, gives every citizen a fundamental right to move around and settle down peacefully any part of the country being a citizen of India everyone should respect this fundamental right of every person. This is the need of the hour is to develop all regions of India without any discrimination, through devolution of power to local governments and empowering people for their participation in decision-making. The governments at state level required to find out the substitute resources of energy, source of employment for local people. </span>
