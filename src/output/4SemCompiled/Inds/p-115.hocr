      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 499 2118 1206">The status of women in India has seen many ups and downs since ancient times from at par status in ancient history to be in veils (Parda System) during the medieval period. In the post independent India the status of women regained its strength and has been on a rise ever since. Women in post independent India have been participating in almost all types of economic activities, day-to-day household responsibilities, voting for better governance and also in active politics. India has elected a women Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, and a women President, Pratibha Patil. In the present Central Government, women comprise roughly quarter of the Indian Cabinet with portfolios like external affairs, commerce and human resource development. At the ground level, India has a significant proportion of women in local level politics which have been achieved by reserving seat for women. </span>

Once she prepares herself, then she has to prepare her husband, and her children, and her family.

And after all this, when her name goes to the party bosses, they do not select her name because they fear losing that seat.‘ The above quote of Sushma Swaraj (Union External Affairs Minister) gives a glimpse of reality that how women have to face so many problems and criticisms while entering the politics. India, being the largest democratic country in the world has very low representation of women in politics. </span>

A double-edged sword has been seen affecting women‘s involvement in Indian politics. By becoming Pradhan or a ward member in a Gram Panchayat or any other civic body, or a member of State Assembly or Parliament, it augments respect within the family as well as in the community at large besides increasing their self-esteem, confidence and decision-making ability. </span>
