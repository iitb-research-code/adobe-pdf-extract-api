The regional political parties have been participating in the union government continuously since 1996.

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1111 2117 2016">Before independence there were few individuals like Mahatma Gandhi,Pandit Moti Lal Nehru, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandar Bose etc. who were dominating the Indian politics .After the Independence Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Mrs. Indira Gandhi, his grandson Rajiv Gandhi and his wife Sonia Gandhi,her son Rahul Gandhi and her daughter Priyanka Vadhera dominated the Indian politics for a sufficient long time. Leaders like Atal Behari Vajpayee,L.K Advani and other leaders of leftist ideology dominated the electoral politics in India. For the past so many years the factor of personality cult had been dividing, but all of sudden a single individual of Bharatiaya Janata Party came to be symbolized with the factor of personality cult. He was non else but sh. Narendra Modi, the present prime minister of the country. The elections to the 16th Lok Sabha revolved around the personality of sh. Narendra Modi. Such a political scenario was created that Modi was everywhere. The people of India could see crowds after crowds crying for Modi and Modi. All this made the elections of the 16th Lok Sabha concentrating on one personality. </span>

Under such conditions these candidates who do not have a clear majority come out victorious. In this situation some political parties form the government and other political parties act as an opposition. The opposition possesses a multi-party character in the parliament of India. Though only one political party is recognized officially as an opposition party in the Lok Sabha, but in the reality many political parties act as an opposition. This type of situation weakens the Indian democracy. Because political parties have mutual differences on one point , these parties spend their times less in making constructive criticism of the government and more in pushing one another behind. </span>
