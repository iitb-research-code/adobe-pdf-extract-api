      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 394 903 937 948">1.2. INTRODUCTION </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1034 2118 1609">The Government in a state functions in quite a similar way to that of the Central Government. The executive head is also the constitutional head, which acts on aid and advice of Council of Ministers. As this Council of Ministers is headed by the Chief Minister on the state level, similarly, the constitutional head of the state government is the Governor. Article 153 of the Constitution of India has created the office of the Governor, where each state shall have one. The proviso to Article 153 states that one person can be the governor of two or more states. Such person shall exercise the executive power either directly or through an office subordinate to him, according to Article 154.  </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1673 1286 1717">1.3. APPOINTMENT OF A GOVERNOR </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1779 2117 2022">According to Article 155, the President of India appoints the Governor of a state. He is elected by neither a direct nor an indirect vote, but by a special electoral college as is done in case of election of the President. Therefore, he is a nominee of the Central Government. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2073 2118 2461">In the case of Hargovind v. Raghukul 1 , it has been held that the office of the Governor of a State is not an employment under the Government of India and it does not come within the prohibition of clause (d) of Article 319 and therefore, a member of the State Public Service Commission can be appointed as the Governor. The office of Governor is an independent office and is not under the control or subordinate to the Government of India. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2523 2116 2701">1.3.1 QUALIFICATIONS: As per Article 157 of the Indian Constitution, a person to be eligible to be appointed as a Governor must be (a) a citizen of India, and (b) must have completed the age of 35 years. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2754 1603 2810">1.3.2. CONDITIONS OF THE GOVERNOR’S OFFICE: </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2871 2117 3049">The Governor cannot be a member of either house of the Parliament or of a house of Legislature of any state.
