      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 935 2118 1311">The Constitution of India provides for a legislature in each State and entrusts it with the responsibility to make laws for the state. However, the composition of a state Legislature can be different in different states. It can be either bicameral or unicameral. Presently, only six states (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, Karnataka Maharashtra and UP) have bicameral legislatures. Twenty-two States and Two Union Territories (Delhi and Puducherry) have uni -cameral Legislatures. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1363 2117 1617">It is provided in Article-168(2), ―Where there are two Houses of the Legislature of State, one shall be known as the legislative council (Vidhan Parishad) and other as Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) and where there is only one House of the State Legislature, it shall be known as the State Legislative Assembly.‖ </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1682 1527 1726">2.3 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (VIDHAN SABHA) </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1787 2118 2428">There is a Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) in every State. It represents the people of State. The members of Vidhan Sabha are directly elected by people on the basis of universal adult franchise. They are directly elected by all adult citizens registered as voters in the State. All men and women who are 18 years of age and above are eligible to be included in the voters‘ List. They vote to elect the members of State Assembly. Members are elected from territorial constituencies. Every State is divided into as many (single member) constituencies as the number of members to be elected. As in case of Lok Sabha, certain number of seats is reserved for Scheduled Castes and in some States for Scheduled Tribes also. This depends on population of these weaker sections in the State. </span>
