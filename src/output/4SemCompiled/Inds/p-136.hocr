      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 507 1731 552">27. DEVELOPMENT OF A POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 637 2117 1675">It is interesting to note that it was for the first time in the history of Independent India that a Political alternative to the congress has emerged in the Indian Political scene. No doubt Janata Dal once in the seventies posed a challenge to the Congress but that was not a real challenge because Janata Dal was a party of old Congressmen and the party was not united to give an ideological fight to the dominance of congress. Janata Dal could not prove itself as an effective political alternative to the Congress. Soon Janata Dal fell astray into several parts and it could not maintain itself as a political alternative to Congress. Till the 16th Lok Sabha elections, Bharatiya Janata Party was not seriously considered by the Political observers an effective alternative to the Congress, but in the 16th Lok Sabha election Bharatiya Janata Party secured a sweeping victory and proved itself to be an effective political alternative to the congress it was a great Leap of Bharatiya Janata Party, because a party with two members in Lok Sabha in 1984 rose to the position of a ruling party with 282 members in May 2014. Thus in the coming times also this party will prove a serious challenge to the disintegrated Congress growing weaker day by day. This is our presumption and it is the future which shall tell the true story of the issue. </span>

The Indian politics has entered into a new era where the BJP in prominence for last about 130 years failed to get even so many seats as might had enabled it to be officially recognized as the opposition party.
