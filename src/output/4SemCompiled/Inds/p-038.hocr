      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1232 2117 2005">In the end we can say that constitutionally the position of the chief minister is merely of an advisor to the Governor in his executive functions. But the position that grows out the constitutional precedents and conventions is altogether different so much so the chief minister has become the real executive functionary today. Actually all policies and decisions of the state government are implemented by the chief minister. The Governor is merely figure head acting on the advice of the chief minister. The advice is more or less binding on him. Thus the executive power inherent in governor‘s hand is just transferred in the hands of the chief minister who, in turn becomes the custodian of absolute power, leaving nothing with the governor. In practice, the Governor becomes an advisor that too just spectatorial adviser. He is head of his council, policy maker and leader of the party all combined together and thus he is all in all executive, administrative and legislative matter. </span>
