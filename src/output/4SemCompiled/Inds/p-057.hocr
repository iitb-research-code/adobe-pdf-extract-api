These include: Only offences that attract a maximum punishment of five years or above should be included within the ambit of this provision. Charges filed within one year before the date of scrutiny of nominations for an election will not lead to disqualification. The disqualification will operate until acquittal by a trial court, or a period of six years, whichever is earlier. The trial of accusations brought against sitting MPs or MLAs must be expedited. It must be carried out on a daily basis and completed in a year. If the trial is not completed within a year, the MP/MLA may be disqualified when that time period expires. Alternatively, the MP/right MLA's to vote in the House as a member, as well as his compensation and other benefits, should be suspended after one year. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1100 2118 1939">Disqualification at the stage of framing of charges must apply retroactively as well. Persons with charges pending (punishable by five years or more) at the time of this law coming into effect must be disqualified from contesting future elections. The safeguards for charges filed within one year of the date of scrutiny of nomination papers would apply. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, must be amended to reflect the following on the problem of filing a false affidavit: Disqualification must be imposed if a person is convicted of filing a fraudulent affidavit. The penalty should be increased from a maximum of six months to a minimum of two years in prison. Falsely filing an affidavit should be considered a "corrupt practice" under the Act. As a result, trials in cases involving fraudulent affidavits must be held on a daily basis. Furthermore, there should be a one-week interval between the deadline for filing nominations and the date of examination. This would allow enough time for an objection to be filed on nomination papers. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2016 2117 2600">255th Law Commission Report 2015 noted that ―the current system tolerates, or at least does not prevent, lobbying and capture, where a sort of quid pro quo transpires between big donors and political parties/candidates‖. The report recommended that political parties should disclose all amounts over Rs. 20,000 received by them, even if from a single donor. It has recommended that the disqualification term for candidates who do not submit proper details of expenditure within the prescribed time be extended, so that they are unable to contest the next election. It has also recommended that candidates should be compelled under some law to disclose all contributions received by them from any person or company, and from the political party. </span>
