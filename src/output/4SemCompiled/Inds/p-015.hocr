Because the President is bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers under Article 74 of the Constitution, in effect it is the central government that appoints and removes the Governors. ―Pleasure of the President‖ merely refers to this will and wish of the central government. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 571 2118 881">In 2010, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court interpreted these provisions and laid down some binding principles (B.P. Singhal v. Union of India 12 ). In this case, the newly elected central government had removed the Governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa in July, 2004 after the 14th Lok Sabha election. When these removals were challenged, the Supreme Court held: </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 902 2116 1080">The President, in effect the central government, has the power to remove a Governor at any time without giving him or her any reason, and without granting an opportunity to be heard. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1096 398 1125"></span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 1100 2118 1278">However, this power cannot be exercised in an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable manner. The power of removing Governors should only be exercised in rare and exceptional circumstances for valid and compelling reasons. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1295 398 1323"></span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 1299 2117 1609">The mere reason that a Governor is at variance with the policies and ideologies of the central government, or that the central government has lost confidence in him or her, is not sufficient to remove a Governor. Thus, a change in central government cannot be a ground for removal of Governors, or to appoint more favourable persons to this post. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 1625 398 1654"></span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 1629 2117 2005">A decision to remove a Governor can be challenged in a court of law. In such cases, first the petitioner will have to make a prima facie case of arbitrariness or bad faith on part of the central government. If a prima facie case is established, the court can require the central government to produce the materials on the basis of which the decision was made in order to verify the presence of compelling reasons. </span>
      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 375 2026 2116 2204">In summary, this means that the central government enjoys the power to remove Governors of the different states, as long as it does not act arbitrarily, without reason, or in bad faith. </span>

      <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 450 2423 2118 2997">The Sarkaria Commission (1988) recommended that Governors must not be removed before completion of their five year tenure, except in rare and compelling circumstances. This was meant to provide Governors with a measure of security of tenure, so that they could carry out their duties without fear or favour. If such rare and compelling circumstances did exist, the Commission said that the procedure of removal must allow the Governors an opportunity to explain their conduct, and the central government must give fair consideration to such explanation. It was further recommended that Governors should be informed of the grounds of their removal. </span>
